## Description
Time Machine for iOS is a Time Machine simulator.  Hopefully Apple will accept this name, as their backup device has the same name.  If not, Time Travel(er) is a backup name.

In any case, Time Machine purports to make your phone or tablet into a time travelling device.  Dates spanning the Big Bang to the Heat Death of the Universe can be visited.  The physics of time travel is simulated (as best as possible).  In addition, time can be slowed down or stopped.  Relativistic time effects can also be experienced, such as the slowing of time as velocities approach the speed of light.

Information about eras visited will be displayed.  Humorous "warning" dialogs about the consequences of time travel can be optionally displayed.

Whether you want to say hi to Buddha, kill baby Hitler, or just delight in creating knotty time paradoxes, Time Machine is your app.
